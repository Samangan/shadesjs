Shadesjs
========


This is a javscript library that allows the user to darken or brighten elements on a webpage.


Purpose
-----------

Right now I am just playing around with this idea to see if it is feasible. Possible applications of this library include randomly changing the colors of elements in a page.



Tech stack:
-----------

 * [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
 * [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for building
 * [BusterJS](busterjs.org) for testing
 * [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/) for linting
