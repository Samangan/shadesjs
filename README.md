Shadejs
=======


This is a javscript library that allows the user to darken or brighten elements on a webpage.


Right now I am just playing around with this idea to see if it feasible. One kind of funny application of this library could be in randomly changing the colors of all of the elements on a page.

Tech stack:
-----------

 * Javscript
 * grunt for building
 * busterjs for testing
 * jshint for linting
